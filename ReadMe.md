# Resilience Score

**Resilience Score** is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to assess and enhance an individualâ€™s financial resilience. Users can securely upload their financial statements, receive a detailed resilience score, view personalized insights, track their progress over time, engage in gamified experiences, and consult with an AI chatbot named **Resilio**.

---

## Problem Statement

Managing personal finances can be overwhelming due to a lack of personalized, insightful, and easy-to-understand tools. Traditional budgeting apps donâ€™t quantify **financial resilience**â€”a personâ€™s ability to withstand financial shocks. Users need a way to **analyze**, **score**, and **improve** their financial health with clarity, accuracy, and interactivity.

---

## Solution Overview

The **Resilience Score** platform addresses this gap by:

- Parsing uploaded statements (CSV).
- Automatically categorizing transactions.
- Calculating a comprehensive **Financial Resilience Score** based on income stability, expenses, savings, and emergency fund capacity.
- Providing a **dashboard**, **score details**, **forecast trends**, **gamified metrics**, and a **personal financial AI assistant** named Resilio.

---

## Key Features

- **Secure Auth with Supabase**
- **File Upload (CSV)** with instant parsing
- **Real-Time Score Calculation**
- **Trend Forecasts and Historical Progress Charts**
- **AI Chatbot Resilio** (via Groq API)
- **Gamification**: Points, Badges, Levels
- **User Settings**
- **Supabase Integration** for user, transaction, and score management
- **Private Routes** and session persistence

---

## Resilience Score Calculation

The **score is a composite metric (0â€“100)** based on:

- Income vs Expenses
- Savings rate
- Emergency buffer (savings/income ratio)
- Spending patterns and transaction categories

Each factor contributes to a weighted breakdown, which is stored in Supabase and shown in the dashboard.
